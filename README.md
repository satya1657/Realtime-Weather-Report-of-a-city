# Realtime-Weather-Report-of-a-city
This is Nodejs based Project.
You can search for any city in the world to know the realtime weather of that city.
I fetch the realtime weather data for any city by using API.
I deployed it on Heroku.

I used a very simple frontend here. I just want to learn how to work with APIs in nodejs in this project.
